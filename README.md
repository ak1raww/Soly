#### Community packages

Below you can find unofficial packages created by the community. They are not officially supported by us, so before reporting issues, please first confirm the issue also happens on official builds. When in doubt, consult with their packager first. The AppImage should work on any distro that supports them, so I recommend you just use that instead!

- Arch Linux: [Soly on the Arch user repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?K=equibop)
- Void Linux: [Soly on the Void repository](https://void.creations.works/)
- NixOS: `nix-shell -p equibop`

## Building from Source

You need to have the following dependencies installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

Packaging will create builds in the dist/ folder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ak1raww/Soly
cd Soly

# Install Dependencies
bun install

# Either run it without packaging
bun start

# Or package (will build packages for your OS)
bun package

# Or only build the Linux Pacman package
bun package --linux pacman

# Or package to a directory only
bun package:dir
```

## Building LibVesktop from Source

This is a small C++ helper library Soly uses on Linux to emit D-Bus events. By default, prebuilt binaries for x64 and arm64 are used.

If you want to build it from source:
1. Install build dependencies:
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install build-essential python3 curl pkg-config libglib2.0-dev`
    - Fedora: `dnf install @c-development @development-tools python3 curl pkgconf-pkg-config glib2-devel`
2. Run `bun buildLibVesktop`
3. From now on, building Soly will use your own build
